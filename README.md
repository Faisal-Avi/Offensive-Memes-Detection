# Offensive-Memes-Detection
Abstract—Aggressive meme is a very potent tool for cyberstalker to bully people online. To ensure a safe online place,
we need a robust mechanism to detect aggressive memes. However, working with a low-resource language like Bangla
presents distinctive challenges. This paper presents BlipART (Blip And banglabeRT), a hybrid multimodal approach that
combines pretrained models to detect aggressive memes in Bengali, where the Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining
(BLIP) and BanglaBERT combination achieves the highest accuracy, which is 99.59%. Our approach integrates enhanced
image preprocessing and employs strategic image augmentation to improve model generalization. This research also develops
a cross-validation approach to demonstrate the robustness of the model. The outcome of this study is interpreted through
XAI, building transparency by showing how the model makes decisions. The proposed system not only addresses linguistic and
cultural nuances in meme-based cyberbullying but also sets a new benchmark for aggression detection, which helps mitigate
online harassment.
